I want to thank the City Council, the County Board of Supervisors, LAHSA, our state, federal and community partners and our service provider partners for locking arms to confront this crisis with the urgency that it requires.

    "There was also a reduction in unsheltered homelessness in L.A. County, with a 5.1% decrease compared to last year, while the shelter count increased by 12.7%.\n",

    "Officials attributed the downward trends to \"unprecedented policy alignment and investments\" made by the city, county, state and federal governments, according to Paul Rubenstein, LAHSA deputy chief of external relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "With more unhoused individuals entering shelter or other forms of temporary housing, Rubenstein said, officials are \"cautiously optimistic about the direction of homelessness across L.A. County\" and are in a position to move more people off the streets and into permanent housing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "L.A. County Supervisor Janice Hahn, meanwhile, released a statement saying, \"For the first time in years, the number of people sleeping on our streets is down and the number of people in our shelters is up. We have focused on shelters and we are doing a better job convincing people to come inside. The next step is building more permanent supportive housing and investing in long- term solutions to this crisis.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The count also noted a reduction in chronic homelessness in the L.A. Continuum of Care, covering most of L.A. County except the cities of Long Beach, Pasadena and Glendale. There were 6.8% fewer people experiencing chronic homelessness -- a term used to describe individuals who have been homeless for more than a year while struggling with a disabling condition -- compared to 2023, the report said. Of those, some 9.4% were unsheltered while 7.5% more were in shelters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Our coordinated efforts are moving the needle and we have to stick together in addition to moving people into interim housing,\" Rubenstein said. \"The rehousing system also gained significant momentum this year. We made a breaking 28,000 permanent housing placements.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He added, \"At this rate, if we could stop anyone else from becoming homeless today, we could end homelessness in just a few years.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the 2024 count showed family homelessness increased by 2.2%, though many families are in temporary housing. Among transition-age youth -- individuals coming out of the foster system between the ages of 16-24 -- homelessness decreased by 16.2% and veteran homelessness decreased by 22.9%.\n",

    "LAHSA reported that about 22% of unhoused individuals report experiencing serious mental illness, while another 24% of unhoused individuals report experiencing substance use disorder -- both figures decreased compared to 2023 and 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the results of the 2023 Homeless Count, L.A county and city officials committed to a collaborative approach to reducing homelessness and bringing unhoused individuals into temporary and permanent housing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In December 2022, Bass launched her Inside Safe initiative in an effort to reduce tents and other encampments across city streets and bring unhoused individuals into temporary housing. Bass and the L.A.

    "What about homelessness in L.A. County?\n",
    "According to the report, there were 75,312 unhoused people in the county in 2024 compared to 75,518 in 2023, a dip of 0.27%;\n",
    "\n",
    "There was also a reduction in unsheltered homelessness in L.A. County, with a 5.1% decrease compared to last year, while the shelter count increased by 12.7%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Officials attributed the downward trends to \"unprecedented policy alignment and investments\" made by the city, county, state and federal governments, according to Paul Rubenstein, LAHSA deputy chief of external relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "With more unhoused individuals entering shelter or other forms of temporary housing, Rubenstein said, officials are \"cautiously optimistic about the direction of homelessness across L.A. County\" and are in a position to move more people off the streets and into permanent housing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "L.A. County Supervisor Janice Hahn, meanwhile, released a statement saying, \"For the first time in years, the number of people sleeping on our streets is down and the number of people in our shelters is up. We have focused on shelters and we are doing a better job convincing people to come inside. The next step is building more permanent supportive housing and investing in long- term solutions to this crisis.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The count also noted a reduction in chronic homelessness in the L.A. Continuum of Care, covering most of L.A. County except the cities of Long Beach, Pasadena and Glendale. There were 6.8% fewer people experiencing chronic homelessness -- a term used to describe individuals who have been homeless for more than a year while struggling with a disabling condition -- compared to 2023, the report said. Of those, some 9.4% were unsheltered while 7.5% more were in shelters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Our coordinated efforts are moving the needle and we have to stick together in addition to moving people into interim housing,\" Rubenstein said. \"The rehousing system also gained significant momentum this year. We made a breaking 28,000 permanent housing placements.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He added, \"At this rate, if we could stop anyone else from becoming homeless today, we could end homelessness in just a few years.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the 2024 count showed family homelessness increased by 2.2%, though many families are in temporary housing. Among transition-age youth -- individuals coming out of the foster system between the ages of 16-24 -- homelessness decreased by 16.2% and veteran homelessness decreased by 22.9%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "LAHSA reported that about 22% of unhoused individuals report experiencing serious mental illness, while another 24% of unhoused individuals report experiencing substance use disorder -- both figures decreased compared to 2023 and 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the results of the 2023 Homeless Count, L.A county and city officials committed to a collaborative approach to reducing homelessness and bringing unhoused individuals into temporary and permanent housing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In December 2022, Bass launched her Inside Safe initiative in an effort to reduce tents and other encampments across city streets and bring unhoused individuals into temporary housing. Bass and the L.A. City Council have also implemented programs aimed at bolstering housing production, increasing shelter beds and sustaining tiny home villages, interim housing sites and other housing facilities with the intent of placing unhoused individuals into permanent housing.\n",
    "\n",
    "County officials launched a similar program to that of Inside Safe, known as Pathway Home, in 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "LASHA officials noted that Measure HHH -- a $1.2 billion bond measure approved by L.A. voters in 2016 -- has played a significant role in building supportive and affordable housing, which in part led to the results seen in the 2024 Homeless Count.\n",
